Breakchain of the web

> Battery of tools for writing code which ensures you cannot be replaced.Ever.


## Features

- FYF - FuckYourFormatting
- Linting - Actually it's the opposite
- Git?Ew - I can't let you use version control bro.
- Occasional color grading changes ( break your syntax highlighting )
- Unloyal? You use extensions apart from BIOTA? We shall break them too!
- Fully compatible with GitHub Copilot—its proactive error recognition treats these "issues" as genuine.





## Requirements

Id suggest disabling all linters and formatters before using this extension. Also, you might want to backup your code before running this extension. Just in case.
