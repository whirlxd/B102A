Breakchain of the web

> BIOME lints and formats your code BIOTA does too just differently.


## Features

- FYF - FuckYourFormatting
- Linting - Actually it's the opposite
- Git?Ew - I can't let you use version control bro.
- Intellisense which hallucinates
- Lazy devs use code actions so we give them wrong ones!
- Occasional color grading changes ( break your syntax highlighting )
- Unloyal? You use extensions apart from BIOTA? We shall break them too!
- Fully compatible with GitHub Copilot—its proactive error recognition treats these quirks as genuine issues.





## Requirements

Disable all linters and formatters before trying this out so as to not interfere with it.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/whirlxd/B102A.git
```
```bash
cd B102A
```
```bash
npm install
```
then press `F5` to start debugging and open the extension in a new window.

## Usage
> **Note:** Sample code is provided in the `sample` folder.

1. Open a new file and write some code.
2. Save the file or run "Biota: Format" from the command palette.
3. Watch the magic happen!
